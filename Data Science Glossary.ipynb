    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of multiclass decisionmaking, we can adjust the perceptron by using a weight vector for each class: weight $w_y$ for class $y$.  The scoring function for a class y now becomes $w_y * f(x)$, and we use the highest score to determine the class:\n",

    "$y = argmax_y [w_y * f(x)]$\n",
    "\n",

    "We repeat these steps until either all inputs are classified correctly or we reach some predetermined accuracy. Step 2b can be seen as adjusting the weight according to whether or not the algorithm correctly classifies the input.  If the actual label is equal to the generated label, then $d_i = y_i(t)$ so $w_j(t+1) = w_j(t) + 0$.  If the labels differ, then we adjust the weight according to the learning rate.\n",

    "\n",
    "The ReLU is useful for several reasons. It can reduce computational complexity by reducing activations, and reducing vanishing/exploding gradient problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vanishing gradient problem naturally results from gradient-based optimization.  Each weight in a neural network receives an update proportional to the partial derivative of the error function with respect to the current weight in each iteration of training.  This can result in a vanishingly small gradient that doesn't meaningfully change the weights, leading to the overall network becoming stuck during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the exploding gradient problem is when constant scaling of weights leads to obscenely huge values that can lead to memory or computational issues during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic ReLU, however, does have its own potential issues.  The dying ReLU problem is when neurons are put into 'dead states' by a large number of weights going to 0.  This can happen when the learning rate is set too high.\n",

    "\n",
    "To work with these perceptron layers, we have to be able to algorithmically optimize the weights in some way. Specifically, we want to maximize the log likelihood probability function of the weights.  We can differentiate the log likelihood function to find the gradient vector consisting of its partial derivatives for each parameter: $\\triangledown_w ll(w) = [\\frac{\\partial ll(w)}{\\partial w_1}, ..., \\frac{\\partial ll(w)}{\\partial w_n}]$\n",
    "\n",
    "This gradient vector gives the local direction of steepest ascent (or descent if we reverse the vector). Gradient ascent is a greedy algorithm that calculates this gradient for the current values of the weight parameters,\n",
    "then updates the parameters along the direction of the gradient, scaled by a step size, $\\alpha$. Specifically the algorithm looks as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize weights $[w_1,...,w_n]$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For $i = 0, 1, 2...$, $w = w + \\alpha \\triangledown_w ll(w)$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to minimize a function $f$ instead of $w$, the update should subtract the scaled gradient $w = w + \\alpha \\triangledown_w f(w)$.  This gives us the gradient descent algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a method for computing gradients for all parameters of the network, we can use gradient descent methods to optimize the parameters to get high accuracy on our training data. For example, suppose we have designed some classification network to output probabilities of classes $y$ for data points $x$, and have $m$ different training datapoints (see the Measuring Accuracy section for more on this). Let $w$ be all the\n",
    "parameters of our network. We want to find values for the parameters $w$ that maximize the likelihood of the true class probabilities for our data, so we have the following function to run gradient ascent on:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ll(w) = log \\prod_{i=1}^n P(y_i | x_i ;w) = \\sum log P(y_i | x_i;w)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x_i,...x_n$ are the n datapoints in the training set.  One way to try to minimize this function is, at each iteration of gradient descent, to use all the data points $x_1,...,x_m$\n",
    "\n",
    "to compute gradients for the parameters w, update the parameters, and repeat until the parameters converge (at which point weâ€™ve reached a local minimum of the function).\n",
    "This technique, known as batch gradient descent, is rarely done in practice, since datasets are typically large enough that computing gradients for this full likelihood function will be very slow. Instead, weâ€™ll typically use mini-batching. Mini-batching rotates through randomly sampled batches of $k$ data points at a time, taking one batch for each step of gradient descent and computing gradients of the loss function using\n",
    "only that batch (so that the sum above is over the $k$ datapoints in the batch, rather than all $m$ datapoints in the training set). This allows us to compute each gradient update much more quickly, and often still makes fast progress toward the minimum of the function. The limit where the batch size $k = 1$ is known as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In SGD, we randomly sample a single example from the training dataset at each step of gradient descent, compute parameter gradients using the networkâ€™s loss on that single\n",

    "#### Backpropagation\n",
    "\n",
    "To efficiently calculate the gradients for each parameter in a neural network, we will use an algorithm known as backpropagation. Backpropagation represents the neural network as a dependency graph of operators and operands, called a computational graph. The graph structure allows us to efficiently compute both the networkâ€™s error (loss) on input data, as well as the gradients of each parameter with respect to the loss. These gradients can be used in gradient descent to adjust the networkâ€™s parameters and minimize the loss on the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The Chain Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "The chain rule is the fundamental rule from calculus which both motivates the usage of computation graphs and allows for a computationally feasible backpropagation algorithm. Mathematically, it states that for a variable $z$ which is a function of $n$ variables $x_1,..., x_n$ and each $x_i$ is a function of $m$ variables $t_1,...,t_m$, then\n",
    "we can compute the derivative of $z$ with respect to any $t_i$ as follows:\n",

    "$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t_i} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1}\\frac{\\partial x_1}{\\partial t_i} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_2}\\frac{\\partial x_2}{\\partial t_i}+...+\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_n}\\frac{\\partial x_n}{\\partial t_i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of computation graphs, this means that to compute the gradient of a given node $t_i$ with respect to the output $z$, we take a sum of children ($t_i$) terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The forward pass is when we calculate the value of a node $k$ by applying each nodeâ€™s operation to its input values coming from its parent nodes until we arrive at node $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The backward pass is when we calculate the gradients of the function computed by the graph: the value after each node is the partial derivative of the last node f value with respect to the variable at that node.  The backward pass computes gradients by starting at the final node (which has a gradient of 1 since $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial f} = 1$ and passing and updating gradients backward through the graph. Intuitively, each nodeâ€™s gradient measures how much a change in that nodeâ€™s value contributes to a change in the final nodeâ€™s value. This will be the product of how much the node contributes to a change in its child node, with how much the child node contributes to a change in the final node. Each node receives and combines gradients from its children, updates this combined gradient based on the nodeâ€™s inputs and the nodeâ€™s operation, and then passes the updated\n",
