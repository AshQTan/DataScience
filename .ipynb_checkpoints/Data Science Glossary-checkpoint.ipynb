    "* Law of Large Numbers - as n, the number of trials, grows larger and approaches infinity,  P(A) approaches \n",
    "* Outcome space - all possible results of a trial, P(outcome space) = 1  for any trial (i.e. the probability of a quarter flipping either heads or tails up is 100%).  The probability of an impossible result is 0.\n",
    "* Complement of an event A ($A_c$ or $\\overline{\\mbox{A}}$, depending on notation) - all events not including A, with total probability of $1 - P(A)$\n",
    "* Union of events A and B ($A \\cup B$) - any event that includes event A, event B, or both A and B.\n",
    "* Intersection of events A and B ($A \\cap B$) - any event that includes both A and B\n",
    "* Subset: An event A is a subset of event B if the A is within B\n",
    "* Partition - an event can be partitioned into non-intersecting sub-events (event A partitioned into sub-events $A_1, A_2...A_n)$.  If the probability of the intersection of sub-events is 0 (no sub-events overlap) then $A_1, A_2...A_n)$ form a partition.\n",
    "    * $A_1, A_2, A_3... A_n$ form a partition of $A$ if $A = A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup A_3 ...\\cup A_n$ and $A_i \\cap A_j$ for all $i \\neq j, i,j \\leq n$ \n",

    "    * Sample space -  the collection of all possible outcomes\n",
    "    * Event space - the collection of all possible sets of possible outcomes.\n",
    "    * Probability measure - a function that maps each event to a probability within the $[0,1]$ interval\n",
    "* Conditional Probability - reframing the probability of an event A given information about the occurrence of some event B\n",
    "* Random Variable - \n",
    "* Distribution - a function that divides the probability of outcome space into subsets in such a way that satisfies the rules of probability. \n",
    "    * For example, the distribution of a coin toss is $P(Heads) = 0.5, P(Tails = 0.5)$.\n",
