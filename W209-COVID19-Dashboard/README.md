# W209-COVID19-Dashboard
COVID-19 Visualization Dashboard (W209 Project)

In this project, we ([@jeffry-zheng](https://github.com/jeffry-zheng), [@AshQTan](https://github.com/AshQTan]), [@weskwong2](https://github.com/weskwong2), [@wenquwang](https://github.com/jack101816)) hope to explore the spread of COVID-19 and the global vaccination effort. We hope that this will be informative to the general public and help increase public willingness to take the COVID vaccine.
