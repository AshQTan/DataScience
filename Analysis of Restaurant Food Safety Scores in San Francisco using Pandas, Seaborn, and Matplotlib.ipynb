The scores and violation information have been made available by the San Francisco Department of Public Health. The main goal for this assignment is to understand how restaurants are scored. We will walk through various steps of exploratory data analysis to do this. We will provide comments and insights along the way to give you a sense of how we arrive at each discovery and what next steps it leads to.\n",

Since this class isn't really about the nuances of the Python file system libraries, we've provided a function for you in ds100_utils.py called `fetch_and_cache` that can download files from the internet.\n",

    "The bar plot shows a generally consistent exponentially increasing distribution of inspection score.  There is a long right tail, but there are significantly more inspections that result in high scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some strange gaps in the 90-100 inspection score range.  It makes sense that all establishments that meet basic health and safety requirements will have at least have a score of 90, which would explain the sudden increase of scores at 90 and beyond.  Another possibility is that past 90 points, there are certain criteria that are harder to meet that cost a certain number of points each (2-3).  Therefore, it would be impossible for the establishments to have scores in between the points given by these criteria.  The anamolous decrease of scores at 98% makes some sense, if a establishment is that good it is likely they are good enough to reach a score of 100, which corresponds to the high number of restaurants that received a score of 100."

Beef tripe tastes like wonton wrap, so mushy and a strong sticky smell, feel like it was reheated from someone's leftovers. Just by think, it already feel yikes. The beef from stir fried rice noodle with beef also not fresh. After had this horrible food, we decide to just left them less than 10% tips since we feel the money doesn't worth the food. The waitress came over and yelled at us and demand more $$, we told them the food are not fresh, she said this food suppose to be this! Are you fxxking kidding me?! We were forced to pay more tips, feel like if we don't pay more we can't walk out from this place. Worst experience ever, don't go if there is another restaurant in the world.\"  -Junbei Z. \n",

This would indicate that scores for the second inspection are higher than the scores for the first inspection.  However, the data seems relatively symmetrical around the x=y line; while there might be a few more points above the x=y line, it's hard to tell, indicating visually that scores generally didn't significantly improve from the first to the second inspection.\n",

However, the bin distribution seems to be symmetically centered at 0, indicating visually that scores generally didn't significantly improve from the first to the second inspection.
